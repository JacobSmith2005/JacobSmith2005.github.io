        This is my github page. I have a 
        collection of 16 repositories, including
        updates to a discord-bot from Falconerd
        and Mr.Gaidos-Personal-Finance-Project. 
        I've also made 107 contributions in the
        last year, as well receiving 3 stars on 
        past projects.

        This is the source code for RandomGame.js
        (See Image Bottom Left), which includes
        the elements previously mentioned. The 
        game is 2D, and is running almost completely
        out of this script.

        This is my "Random Game", created
        entirely in Javascript and HTML.
        (Show Top Right and Bottom Right
        Images). It was created on a canvas 
        with multiple images for characters
        and sound effects for game events.

        This is the source code for the html
        file that shows the RandomGame.js game.
        This displays the canvas that the game
        operates through, and formats the
        background image.
